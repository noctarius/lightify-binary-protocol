OSRAM
link:https://www.osram.com/osram_com/tools-and-services/tools/lightify---smart-connected-light/[Lightify] is a smart home, connected lightning technology. Lights, switches and other paired devices are controlled using the Lightify gateway device. This gateway is an always-on, always-connected device which can be controlled using the official Lightify REST API on the Lightify Cloud. That, however, means that all commands need to be routed through the internet.

The official Lightify app, on the other hand, communicates directly with the gateway and uses a proprietary binary protocol which is not publicly specified.

This document is meant to create a public specification of the known facts about how to discover gateway devices, paired devices and zones/groups, as well as how to control those devices.

== Basics about the Protocol

The OSRAM Lightify gateway protocol is a binary protocol with a specified header.

The underlying protocol is a persistent TCP connection which does not seem to support multiplexing, therefore multiple requests should be sent one after another. To support multithreading, multiple connections should be used.

The TCP protocol works over port _4000_ and discovery can be implemented using mDNS (multicast DNS, aka Bonjour). Further information in <<Lightify Gateway Discovery>>.

Multibyte values encoded using little-endian encoding and considered unsigned values.

String values are encoded using UTF-8 encoding and of fixed length. Unused bytes are filled with _0x00_ and should be trimmed out to get the real string.

=== Headers

The protocol defines a common header for both requests and responses. The header consists of the packet's length, a packet type and the command id.

Furthermore the header contains a request id which is recommended, but not required, to be monotonly increasing but must wrapping around to startover when surpassing _0xFFFFFFFF_. The response will feature the same request id and can be used to correlate responses with requests.

.Packet Header
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Data type

| 0-1
| Length of the packet, excl header length
| uint16_t

| 2
| Packet type (flag)
| uint8_t: enum { +
  _0x00_: Light Device +
  _0x01_: Device response? +
  _0x02_: Broadcast / Zone Command +
  _0x03_: Zone Response? +
}

| 3
| Command Id
| uint8_t: See <<Lightify Commands>>

| 4-7
| Unique, increasing request id
| uint32_t

|===

Response packets have an additional field in the header, which seems to return a status / error code for the request.

.Response Header Status Code
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Data type

| 8
| Status code?
| uint8_t: enum { +
_0x00_: No error? +
_0x01_: Wrong (number of) parameter(s)? +
_0x14_: ? +
_0x15_: Command is not a broadcast? +
_0x16_: Resync required (gateway expects the next packet to be <<PACKET_LIST_PAIRED_DEVICES>>)
_0xA7_: ? +
_0x0B_: ? +
_0xC2_: ? +
_0xD1_: ? +
_0xFF_: Unknown command? +
}

|===

If the packet is not a broadcast (addressing type != _0x02_), the device or zone address header is following up right after the header. In case of a broadcast, the header is followed by the commands data. Addressing of specific zones or devices is defined in the following section.

=== Error Response

In case of an illegally addressed packet or any other type of error, an error response packet is returned from the gateway. The packet consists of the header only and the last byte seems to define an error code. See previous table for a list of known? error codes.

== Device Types

The OSRAM Lightify gateway uses the Zigbee Light Link communication protocol, however it is also able to communicate with certain other device types of the Lightify series, such as switches, motion sensors and power plugs / sockets.

A device type is sent with status updates to identify the type of the device as well as the capabilities of a specific device.

.Device Type
|===
| Id | Description

| 1
| Bulb: Fixed white, dimmable, non-softswitch

| 2
| Bulb: Tunable white, dimmable, soft-switchable

| 4
| Bulb: Fixed white, dimmable, soft-switchable

| 10
| Bulb: RGB, tunable white, dimmable, soft-switchable

| 16
| Plug / Power socket

| 32
| Motion Sensor

| 64
| Switch (2 switches)

| 65
| Switch (4 switches)

|===

== Device and Zone Addressing

Each paired device has a unique address (MAC). Multiple paired devices can be controlled at once by adding them to zones / groups, which are addressed using the zone's id.

An address always contains 8 byte, no matter it's adressing a device or zone and is directly followed by the command's specific data.

.Addressing Header
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Data type

| 8-15
| Address
| uint64_t: See the following specification

| 16-...
| Command specific data
| See <<Lightify Commands>>

|===

=== Device address

Devices are addressed by, what seems to be, a hardware address, similar to MAC addresses used in networking devices.

.Device Addressing
|===
| Byte(s) | Description | Data type

| 0-7
| Device address
| uint64_t

|===

While discovering devices the device's address is made known to the application, controlling the gateway, and the paired device can be addressed directly (whereas the command packet is still routed through the gateway).

*Attention:* Device addresses are transmitted as 8 bytes, not as strings!

=== Zone address

Zones are identified by their zone id. Addressing itself, however, is still using 8 bytes, even if zone ids seem to be limited to _0xFFFF_. That said, the addressing is built as following:

.Zone Addressing
|===
| Byte | Data type

| 1
| uint8_t: lower significant byte

| 2
| uint8_t: higher significant byte

| 3-7
| uint8_t[6]: _0x00_

|===

*Attention:* Also note, that zone commands have a packet type of _0x02_ at byte position _2_ in the packet's header.

== Lightify Gateway Discovery

To discover the OSRAM Lightify gateway's IP address, a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS[mDNS (multicast DNS)] request is used. mDNS is also known as Bonjour and is originally developed by Apple.

To find the gateway's address a SSDP lookup request is sent to the UDP broadcast address _224.0.0.251_ (IPv4) or _FF02::FB_ (IPv6). The service type to search for is `_http._tcp` which will find a Lightify device named as `Lightify-XXXXXXXX`, where `XXXXXXXX` is a part of the gateway's serial number (`S/N: OSRXXXXXXXX-YY`) which is also used in the gateway's own SSID (last 6 numbers of the code).

Since more items, especially of other vendors, might be found, the instance name should be tested for starting with `Lightify-` to make sure only the Lightify gateway is discovered.

According to the search type and the mDNS response, there is supposed to be a HTTP service on port 80, which does not seem to exist. However, the gateway seems to communicate over link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC[QUIC] to the OSRAM servers, so maybe the port 80 is also available using QUIC.

After discovering the gateway's IP address, the communication port to use the described protocol is TCP/4000.

Lightify devices and zones will be discovered using the gateway binary protocol, using tge commands <<PACKET_LIST_PAIRED_DEVICES>> and <<PACKET_LIST_ZONES>>.

== Lightify Commands

Lightify commands are either used for broadcasts, like device or zone discovery, or contain information to control a specfic device or zone.

The following table is most probably incomplete and more commands are available. Response packets often follow a very similar scheme, therefore it should be easy to find new packets and analyze their content.

Known command ids are put into the following list:

|===

As visible from the list, a lot of command ids seem either unused or, what is more presumable, unknown at the current point in time.
